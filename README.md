# Training stiff neural ordinary differential equations in data-driven wastewater process modelling

The folder ASM1_python contains code in python simulating an IVP from extended ASM1 model with neural ordinariy differential equations. Please click the "main" file to run. The traing uses package of torchdiffeq with the proposed z-score standardisation. You can "comment" or "uncomment" the lines in the code to choose the other methods to test as well.

The folder ASM2d_N2O_matlab contains code in matlab simulating an IVP from ASM2d_N2O model with : 1) normalisation method 2) collocation method and 3) incremental strategy. Please click the "main" file to run.
